A python package for working with SEC filings at scale. Integrated with [datamule's endpoints](https://datamule.xyz/products).

* [Documentation](https://john-friedman.github.io/datamule-python/datamule-python/quickstart/)

## Datamule's Endpoints (requires API Key)

I host a bunch of useful stuff in the cloud, such as:
* SEC Websocket (Free)
* SEC Archive without rate limits ($1/100,000 downloads)
* SEC MySQL RDS ($1/million rows retrieved)
    - SEC XBRL
    - Company Fundamentals
    - Proxy Voting Records

Pricing is meant to cover usage + if I make money that's cool.
